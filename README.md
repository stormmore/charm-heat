Overview
========

Heat is the main project in the OpenStack Orchestration program. It implements
an orchestration engine to launch multiple composite cloud applications based
on templates in the form of text files that can be treated like code.

This charm deploys the Heat infrastructure.

Usage
=====

Heat requires the existence of the other core OpenStack services deployed via
Juju charms, specifically: mysql, rabbitmq-server, keystone and
nova-cloud-controller. The following assumes these services have already
been deployed.

After deployment of the cloud, the domain-setup action must be run to configure
required domains, roles and users in the cloud for Heat stacks:

    juju action do heat/0 domain-setup

This is only required for >= OpenStack Kilo.

Network Space support
---------------------

This charm supports the use of Juju Network Spaces, allowing the charm to be bound to network space configurations managed directly by Juju.  This is only supported with Juju 2.0 and above.

API endpoints can be bound to distinct network spaces supporting the network separation of public, internal and admin endpoints.

Access to the underlying MySQL instance can also be bound to a specific space using the shared-db relation.

To use this feature, use the --bind option when deploying the charm:

    juju deploy heat --bind "public=public-space internal=internal-space admin=admin-space shared-db=internal-space"

alternatively these can also be provided as part of a juju native bundle configuration:

    heat:
      charm: cs:xenial/heat
      num_units: 1
      bindings:
        public: public-space
        admin: admin-space
        internal: internal-space
        shared-db: internal-space

NOTE: Spaces must be configured in the underlying provider prior to attempting to use them.

NOTE: Existing deployments using os-*-network configuration options will continue to function; these options are preferred over any network space binding provided if set.
