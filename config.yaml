    type: string
    default: distro
    description: |
      Repository from which to install. May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,

      See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OpenStack/CloudArchive for info on which
      cloud archives are available and supported.
      .
      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.
  openstack-origin-git:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Specifies a default OpenStack release name, or a YAML dictionary
      listing the git repositories to install from.
      .
      The default Openstack release name may be one of the following, where
      the corresponding OpenStack github branch will be used:
        * liberty
        * mitaka
        * newton
        * master
      .
      The YAML must minimally include requirements and heat repositories,
      and may also include repositories for other dependencies:
        repositories:
        - {name: requirements,
           repository: 'git://github.com/openstack/requirements',
           branch: master}
        - {name: heat,

  action-managed-upgrade:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.

    default:
    description: |
      The CPU core multiplier to use when configuring worker processes for
      this service.  By default, the number of workers for each daemon is
